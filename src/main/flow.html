  <h2> Out-of-Flow Positioning </h2>
  <p>
    It is sometimes useful to take elements out of their normal flow and move or copy them into
    other containers. Examples include <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a>, <a
    href="#endnotes">volume endnotes</a>, and <a href="#">repeated content at the beginning of
    volumes</a>. This section describes a generic mechanism for moving content, called “<a
    title="named flow">named flows</a>”. CSS is not a transformation language; the motivation for
    supporting <a title="named flow">named flows</a> is presentational rather than structural.

  <div class="note">

      The approach taken in braille CSS is inspired by a number of CSS concepts and features

    <h3> Named Flows </h3>
    <p>
      A <dfn>named flow</dfn> is the ordered sequence of content associated with a flow with a given
      identifier. Content is placed into a named flow with the <a class="css-propname">flow</a>
      property, and taken out using the <a class="css-propval">flow()</a> value of the <a
      class="css-propname">content</a> property. The same element can participate in more than one flow
      (including the normal flow), and a named flow can have multiple sources and multiple
      destinations. This makes it possible to not only move but also copy and repeat content.

      <p>
        The <a class="css-propname">flow</a> property causes an element to participate in the specified
        flow. The value must be one of the following:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>normal</dt>
        <dd>
          This value causes an element or pseudo-element to participate in the normal flow.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <a href="CSS3VAL#identifier-value" class="externalDFN"><var>&lt;custom-ident&gt;</var></a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This value causes an element or pseudo-element to participate in the <a>named flow</a>
          with the specified name. The element or pseudo-element will not generate a box at the
          original position in the DOM.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The <a class="css-propname">flow</a> property does not affect the DOM position of an element or
        its contents, and it does not affect the CSS cascade and inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visual formatting model however uses the relationships between content in the <a>named
        flow</a> as input, rather than the contents' original position in the DOM. Elements
        channelled into a <a>named flow</a> become siblings. A box establishes a containing block
        for the content it consumes using the <a class="css-propval">flow()</a> function. Elements in a
        <a>named flow</a> are ordered according to their document order.

    <section id="the-alternate-and-duplicate-pseudo-elements">
      <h4>
        The <a class="css">::alternate</a> and <a class="css">::duplicate</a> pseudo-elements
      </h4>
      <p>
        Content can be generated or duplicated using the <a class="css">::alternate</a> and <a
        class="css">::duplicate</a> pseudo-elements. The content of an <dfn
        class="css">::alternate</dfn> pseudo-element is determined by its <a
        class="css-propname">content</a> property. The content of a <dfn
        class="css">::duplicate</dfn> pseudo-element is copied from the element in the document tree
        to which it is associated. The <code>::alternate(<var>&lt;n&gt;</var>)</code> and
        <code>::duplicate(<var>&lt;n&gt;</var>)</code> notations can be used to create several <span
        class="css">::alternate</span> or <span class="css">::duplicate</span> pseudo-elements for
        one given element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a class="css-propname">flow</a> property dictates in which flow a pseudo-element
        participates. A value <span class="css-propval">normal</span> causes the pseudo-element to
        be included where the element in the document tree to which it is associated would be
        positioned. It is not allowed that several pseudo-elements associated to the same element
        participate in the same flow (normal or named flow), nor that they participate in the same
        flow as the element they are associated to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other <a href="#h3_pseudo-elements">pseudo-elements</a>, these pseudo-elements
        inherit from the parent of the element to which it they are associated, not from that
        element itself.

      <h4> The <a class="css-propval">flow()</a> function </h4>
      <p>
        The <a class="css-propval">flow()</a> function is used to consume <a title="named flow">named
        flows</a>, via the <a class="css-propname">content</a> property. The function requires one
        argument, the name of the flow. Elements in the named flow are rendered as children of the
        block container on which the <a class="css-propname">content</a> property is specified. In the
        default case, all elements in a named flow are consumed as many times as there are <span
        class="css-propval">flow()</span> calls. This behaviour can be overridden with an optional
        second argument that specifies which elements should be included. Elements in a flow are
        duplicated as many times as needed in order to meet the demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          <dfn>flow()</dfn> = flow( <a href="CSS3VAL#identifier-value"
          class="externalDFN"><var>&lt;custom-ident&gt;</var></a> [, [ document | volume ] ]?
          )
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second argument dictates the search direction and range and is one of the following
        keywords:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <!--
        <dt> backward </dt>
        <dd>
          The elements that were added to the flow prior to this call and were not consumed yet by a
          previous call are inserted here. <span class="css-propval">backward</span> is the default
          value.
        </dd>
        <dt> forward </dt>
        <dd>
          The elements that will be added to the flow after this call and before the next are inserted
          here.
        </dd>
        -->
        <dt> document </dt>
        <dd>

        <dd>
          All the elements that have been added to the flow within the current volume or will be
          added later within the current volume are inserted here.

    <h3> Generated Lists </h3>
    <p>
      Books typically have sections that can be referred to as generated lists. They are generated
      from the main content, and have the nature of lists. Examples include a table of contents, an
      index, a glossary, a list of figures, a list of tables and an endnote section.
